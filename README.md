# Currency Converter Project

## Overview

This project is a simple currency converter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert between different currencies by entering an amount and selecting the currencies to convert from and to.

## Features

- **Amount Input:** Allows users to enter the amount to be converted.
- **Currency Selection:** Dropdowns for selecting the "from" and "to" currencies.
- **Conversion Result:** Displays the converted amount.
- **Responsive Design:** Adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the currency converter.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the currency converter.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling the conversion logic.

## Usage

1. **Open the currency converter page in your web browser.**
2. **Interact with the converter:**
    - Enter the amount you want to convert.
    - Select the currency to convert from.
    - Select the currency to convert to.
    - Click the "Convert" button to see the result.
3. **View the result:**
    - The converted amount will be displayed below the form.

## How It Works

- **HTML:** Defines the structure of the currency converter, including the input fields and dropdowns.
- **CSS:** Provides styling for the currency converter to ensure a clean and user-friendly appearance.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the conversion logic, including fetching exchange rates and calculating the converted amount.

## Notes

- This currency converter uses a static exchange rate for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, consider integrating with a reliable currency exchange rate API.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation for production use.
